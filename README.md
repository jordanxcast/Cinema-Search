# Cinema Search 
Platform for users to search the OMDB API by movie title. Search a title, and see the results in a grid format below including movie title, release year and poster image. User can click on the delete button ot remove the movie from the generated results. If the user scrolls down the page, a coveninent button appears to scroll back to ths top for improved user experience. Overall appearance of the platform is clean and simple so the focus remains on the movies the user is searching for.
